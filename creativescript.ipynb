The first is product led growth, and that\\'s when your products sell themselves and ascend people into traditional products or services without you having to do any work. [...] And the second part of it is that you want to have recurring revenue. [...] So we launched a membership site. About 90 days ago at this point. And we\\'re generating tens of thousands of dollars a month.\"', '\"The first is that we have a bi-weekly meeting with an agenda on this agenda We\\'re covering things like sharing the wins from the past two weeks, both personal and professional We go through each other\\'s life visions or life manifestos.

The second system we set up is a quarterly goal setting system myself and my partner We both want to be people that are always progressing forward And so every single quarter we set a goal and we put it inside of Asana and we track it on those bi-weekly meetings. So, for example, my goal last quarter was to create an elevated wardrobe that has an elevated style That gets me compliments everywhere I go and I was able to do that and then my girlfriend\\'s hers was that she wanted to create a money-making Opportunity that she felt fulfilled Doing and that she was generating money from by the end of the quarter and she did that when she launched a membership site.

So once you already are getting a certain amount of people from a certain kind of structure, whether it\\'s a video call Funnel, a cold call, an email, you have a little bit of a system behind it.

The agency model has a benefit because it's super easy to sell agency services. The build and release model slash offer is beneficial because it's better for you. You don't have to manage people ongoing like a team and you can just place talent in other people's businesses. There's like the growth partner model. You take 10% revenue share. That also for me was too complicated. I don't wanna have only 5-10 clients that produce all my revenue cause there's so much risk involved in that.

Because the longer someone spends on their platform, the more they get paid from ads. So if a person spends time watching your content, it gets pushed to more people with similar interests. Otherwise, if the content doesn't grab the viewers' attention, it gets no boost.

For example, with my Instagram content, people are trying to figure out how to grow an Instagram following from 0 to over 200,000 followers in six weeks. Next, come up with 3-4 different ways to answer those questions. For example, you could answer the question by creating a video, a blog post, an Instagram carousel, or a personal story.

The agency model has a benefit because it's super easy to sell agency services. The build and release model slash offer is beneficial because it's better for you. You don't have to manage people ongoing like a team and you can just place talent in other people's businesses. There's like the growth partner model. You take 10% revenue share. That also for me was too complicated. I don't wanna have only 5-10 clients that produce all my revenue cause there's so much risk involved in that. If one of those clients leave 25% of your revenue's cut out, I personally think is the best if you want simplicity, high margins, and great client results.

For example, if you want to get a viral video about fitness, search for 'fitness' and you'll get a bunch of different niche ideas. Once you have a niche, you want to search for a hook that relates to that niche. For example, 'How do I get a six pack?' is a good hook for a fitness niche. Now, you want to take that hook and search for a buildup. For example, you could say, 'How do you get a six pack? I'm not working out.' This sets up the context for your viewers and leads them into the final part of your content, which is the solution. So, in this case, the solution would be to show them a quick and easy way to get a six pack without working out, such as by using a specific diet or supplement. By following this structure of hook, buildup, and solution, you can create engaging and viral content ideas using ChadGBT or any other content idea generator.\n",

Now, we can take each of these three main points and break them down into three sub-points. For example, for the first main point, we could break down the sub-points into: why protein powders are good for you, how protein powders help you build muscle, and how protein powders can help you lose weight. Now, we've broken down the main point into three sub-point, and we can take each sub-point and break it down into two more sub-points. This gives us a total of seven sub-points that we can cover in our video.

And the reason is because social media is the most powerful marketing tool out there. And if you don't have a social media manager, you're missing out on 90% of your marketing. And if you do have a social media person, you need to pay them $100 a day to make $1000 a month. And the third employee you need to hire is a personal trainer.

You wanna hire a sales person because although you're gonna have to pay them 10% of your sales, it's gonna get you back six to eight hours a day to get more appointments on your calendar to then hire more sales people to be able to scale.\n",

And that's how you can scale your network marketing business without having to go out and prospect everyone you see.\"\n",
            "Actual Body: Number one, you need a scalable model. So instead of relying on other team members and outdated systems, you need a predictable acquisition system that's going to get you direct results. Number two, you need to take your cold following and turn it into warm prospects who know like and trust you by posting Instagram and YouTube content. The biggest mistake network marketers make is they think they can prospect their entire audience without gaining their trust first. And finally, number three, you need to do everything while building a personal brand no direct response, no cold outreach. Just run simple profile visit ads just like this one to grow your brand and attract ideal clients.\n",

So we make sure those things are aligned We review our quarterly goals and rocks, which I'll talk about in a second here. And then we discuss any issues that we're going through we feel like the other person isn't noticing Or that we want to solve and we solve them once and for all on that call Creating a safe environment for us to kind of knock forward in our relationship. The second system we set up is a quarterly goal setting system myself and my partner We both want to be people that are always progressing forward And so every single quarter we set a goal and we put it inside of Asana and we track it on those bi-weekly meetings. So, for example, my goal last quarter was to create an elevated wardrobe that has an elevated style That gets me compliments everywhere I go and I was able to do that and then my girlfriend's hers was that she wanted to create a money-making Opportunity that she felt fulfilled Doing and that she was generating money from by the end of the quarter and she did that when she launched a membership site. So we both were able to add and help each other along the goals setting process And we were holding each other accountable. The third way I treat my relationship Like a business is making sure we have crystal clear communication So what I've learned managing dozens of employees is even just one or two words wrong Message in email a text message or on a call could have disastrous implications.\"\n",
